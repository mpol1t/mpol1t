# Hi, I'm Michal 👋

AI & Software Engineer - **Independent Contractor (UK Ltd)**

I design and deliver **high-throughput backends**, **streaming data pipelines**, and **ML infrastructure** - with a bias for correctness, observability, and performance. My background spans e-commerce, telecom, and algorithmic trading.

- **Academic foundation:** BEng in Artificial Intelligence & Software Engineering; MSc (in progress) in High Performance Computing and Data Science at the University of Edinburgh.
  
  Current thesis: **neuroevolution & multi-agent reinforcement learning in StarCraft II** (RL + large-scale parallelism).

---

## What I Do

- **Backend & APIs:** Elixir (Phoenix/Ash/Broadway), Python (FastAPI); domain modeling, testing, clean service boundaries.  
- **Data platforms:** Kafka/RabbitMQ streaming, Dask/Pandas batch; data contracts, reliability, and backpressure.  
- **ML & RL engineering:** PyTorch/Lightning; experiment pipelines, model serving, performance tuning.  
- **HPC & performance:** MPI/OpenMP/CUDA, parallel algorithms, profiling, scale-out strategy.  
- **Trading & feeds:** resilient WebSocket ingestion at scale; exchange integrations and fault-tolerant consumers.  
- **Cloud & ops:** AWS, Docker, CI/CD; pragmatic SRE and observability.

**Engagements:** project delivery • part-time retainers • audits & performance tuning • interim engineering  
**Availability:** remote (UK/EU-friendly) • on-site by arrangement

## How I Work

- **Correct by design.** Make state explicit; keep pure cores with well-bounded effects; utilize Property-Based Testing.  
- **Design for failure.** Backpressure, retries, idempotency, clear SLIs/SLOs.  
- **Measure first.** Profile before optimizing; choose the simplest tool that meets the SLO.  
- **Small surface area.** Cohesive modules, minimal dependencies, clear contracts.
