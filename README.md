# Hi, I'm Michal 👋

I'm a AI & Software Engineer with a passion for building scalable, data-driven systems. I specialize in backend architecture, data pipelines, and functional programming — designing fast, reliable software for complex problems across e-commerce, telecom, and algorithmic trading.

With a BEng in Artificial Intelligence and an ongoing MSc in High Performance Computing at the University of Edinburgh, I bring a strong academic foundation to practical engineering. My current thesis explores neuroevolution and multi-agent deep reinforcement learning in the StarCraft II environment — combining reinforcement learning, large scale parallelism, and agent-oriented design.

Whether it's optimizing a dataflow or architecting clean services, I focus on solutions that are correct by design, scalable, and built to last.
