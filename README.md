# Hi, I'm Michal 👋

AI & Software Engineer • **Independent Contractor (UK Ltd)**

I help companies optimize, scale, and modernize cloud-based systems, whether that’s high-throughput backends, streaming data platforms, or ML infrastructure. My focus: correctness, observability, and performance.

I’ve delivered solutions in e-commerce, telecom, and algorithmic trading, and helped clients scale workloads on Azure and AWS for significant cost and latency improvements.

## What I Do for Clients

- **Backend & APIs:** Elixir (Phoenix/Ash/Broadway), Python (FastAPI) - clean service boundaries, domain-driven design, reliable APIs.  
- **Data platforms:** Kafka/RabbitMQ streaming, Dask/Pandas batch - backpressure handling, data contracts, high availability.  
- **Cloud & Infrastructure:** Azure, AWS, Docker, CI/CD - system audits, scaling strategies, performance tuning, SRE practices.  
- **ML & RL engineering:** PyTorch/Lightning - experiment pipelines, distributed training, model deployment and optimization.  
- **HPC & Performance:** MPI/OpenMP/CUDA - parallel algorithms, profiling, large-scale compute.  
- **Trading & Feeds:** resilient WebSocket ingestion at scale - exchange integrations, low-latency pipelines.  

**Engagements:**  
- 🚀 **Project delivery** (design & implementation)  
- 🔍 **Performance audits** (bottlenecks, cost optimization)  
- 🤝 **Part-time retainers** (ongoing support & scale-out strategy)  
- 🧑‍💻 **Interim engineering** (helping teams bridge expertise gaps)  

**Availability:** Remote (UK/EU-friendly) • On-site by arrangement

## How I Work

- ✅ **Correct by design** - explicit state, pure cores, property-based testing.  
- 🛡 **Resilient systems** - retries, idempotency, observability, clear SLIs/SLOs.  
- 📈 **Performance-driven** - profile before optimizing, tune for cost/performance balance.  
- 🧩 **Lean & modular** - small surface area, clear contracts, minimal dependencies.
